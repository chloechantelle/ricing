<h2>AHK - </h2>

All scripts that I use, change the locations in Scrot, and my tiling is setup for two monitors so obviously only some hotkeys would work with one, ~make sure numlock is turned off~.

<h2>BBLEAN - </h2>

Plugins that I've edited for bbLean, styles that I've made for it.

<h2>FB2 - </h2>

Includes all components that you'd need for the skins, if it doesn't work install the ncmp mod and follow the [faq](http://pastebin.com/QbGNnzsZ) for that, if you're already familar with fb (and installed the mod) you won't have any problems.

<h2>MISC RICE - </h2>

As the title says, programs that make ricing a lot easier.

<h2>RAINMETER - </h2>

Skins that I use, either made from scratch or super super edited from someone else.

To get the temps and percentages to work:
 - Run OpenHardwareMonitor (included) 
 - Put a shortcut to it in your startup folder
 - Edit the System Info skin and change the hardware information to your own.

<h2>STARTPAGES - </h2>

Contains multiple startpages I've made, see the live previews [here](http://mokocchi.cf/homepage) and [here](http://mokocchi.cf/Aperture).

<h2>VS - </h2>

Read [this](http://neiio.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Install-Custom-Themes-262833454) if you've never installed a VS, make sure to patch your windows before complaining in desktop threads about a VS not working.

All versions of Nocturnal are included, also contains a updated Mokocchi (looks a little better than Version 1), Siren (Nocturnal but blue basically) and Neko which I'm currently using and constantly changing.

I upload my CSS [here](https://userstyles.org/users/268662) now and update them pretty frequently so I won't bother keeping them at git/gist.
VS's and other things are uploaded [here](http://decagonal.deviantart.com/)~
